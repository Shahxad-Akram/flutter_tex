# Flutter TeX

A Flutter Application demonstrates how to render **Mathematics, Physics** and **Chemistry Equations** based on **LaTeX** with full html support using [webview_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webview_flutter) plugin . This is based on [mini-mathjax](https://github.com/electricbookworks/mini-mathjax) a simplified version of [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/) a JavaScript library.
