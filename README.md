# Flutter TeX

A Flutter Package to render so many types of equations based on **LaTeX**, most commonly used are as followings:

**Mathematics / Maths Equations** (Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Geometry etc...)

**Physics Equations**

**Signal Processing Equations**

**Chemistry Equations**

**Statistics / Stats Equations**

Rendering of equations depends on [mini-mathjax](https://github.com/electricbookworks/mini-mathjax) a simplified version of [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/) a JavaScript library.
 
It also includes full **HTML Rendering** with **JavaScript** support.

This package mainly depends on [webview_flutter](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/webview_flutter) plugin.


**Only Tested on Android not on iOS because I don't own a Mac.**

## Use this package as a library in your flutter Application

**1:** Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_tex: ^1.0.0
```

**2:** You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
$ flutter packages get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter packages get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

**3:** Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_tex/flutter_tex.dart';
```
**4:** Make sure to add this line `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in your `<project-directory>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` under `application` like this.
```xml
<application
       android:usesCleartextTraffic="true">
</application>
```
For iOS add following code in your `<project-directory>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`
```plist

<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
  
  <dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key> <true/>
  </dict>
